# MIDI Implementation

This describes what messages SpessaSynth can receive.

[Here is a useful resource about the MIDI standard. It's in japanese, but all the PDFs are english.](https://amei.or.jp/midistandardcommittee/RP&CAj.html)

## Supported MIDI Messages

!!! Note

     ⚠️NON-STANDARD!⚠️ means that this is an additional modulator that is not specified in the SF2 specification.

## Controllers

### Default Supported Controllers

Below is the list of controllers supported by default.
!!! Note

    Theoretically all controllers are supported as it depends on the SoundFont's modulators. These are the controllers that are supported by default/have default modulators.

    For more info, see [default modulators](../sound-bank/modulator.md#default-modulators)

| 0       | 5       | Channel Modulation Depth | The channel's modulation (vibrato) depth.

### Supported Non-Registered Parameters

Below is the list of currently implemented Non-Registered Parameters.
Note that all these are non-standard GM.
**These only apply for GS**

| NRPN MSB | NRPN LSB | Name              | Explanation                                                                                 | Default        |
|----------|----------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| 0x1      | 0x8      | Vibrato rate      | Controls the vibrato rate. The calculation to hertz is as follows: `hz = (value / 64) * 8`  | 0 (disabled)   |
| 0x1      | 0x9      | Vibrato depth     | Controls the vibrato depth. Depth in cents is as calculated as follows: `cents = value / 2` | 0 (disabled)   |
| 0x1      | 0xA      | Vibrato delay     | Controls the vibrato delay. Calculation to seconds is as follows: `s = (64 / value) / 3`    | 0 (disabled)   |
| 0x1      | 0x20     | TVF Filter Cutoff | Controls the filter cutoff using the CC 74 (brightness)                                     | 64 (no change) |
| 0x01     | 0x66     | EG Release Time   | Controls the volume envelope release time using CC 72                                       | 64 (no change) |
| 0x01     | 0x64     | EG Attack Time    | Controls the volume envelope attack time using CC 73                                        | 64 (no change) |

#### Custom Vibrato

The NPRN vibrato messages have special behavior.
Any value other than 64 received for any of the states activates it with the default settings:

- depth = 50 cents
- rate = 8 Hz
- delay = 0.6s

After which any changes received through the NRPN (including the one that triggered it) are enabled.
This behavior has existed since the beginning of this program as a way to enhance the TH MIDI files,
the original target of SpessaSynth.

[It can be disabled.](https://github.com/spessasus/spessasynth_lib/blob/b0716295820fc6b2e8873a1b0871ca6a0266ea02/src/synthetizer/worklet_processor.js#L281-L292)

#### SoundFont2 NRPN

As of 3.26.15, spessasynth supports the standard SF2 NRPN implementation.

#### AWE32 NRPN Compatibility Layer

As of 3.26.11, spessasynth supports emulation of the AWE32 NRPN generator modification.
The parameter interpretation is similar to fluidsynth's emulation,
as it has been tested and found relatively accurate to the sound cards.
Here are some useful resources about this:

- [AWE32 Frequently Asked Questions](http://archive.gamedev.net/archive/reference/articles/article445.html)
- [AWE32 Developer's Information Pack](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15757220/adip301.pdf)
- [S. Christian Collins's AWE32 MIDI Conversion Repository](https://github.com/mrbumpy409/AWE32-midi-conversions)
- [S. Christian Collins's AWE32 NRPN Filter Tests](https://github.com/mrbumpy409/SoundFont-Spec-Test/tree/main/NRPN%20test%20-%20filter)
- [Fluidsynth AWE32 NPRN implementation](https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/wiki/FluidFeatures#nrpn-control-change-implementation-chart)

There are a few differences from fluidsynth's implementation:

- LSB 16 overrides the `fineTune` generator instead of emitting a pitch-wheel event
- Effect generators get overriden directly rather than passing through the modulator
- Filter cutoff and Q have been tuned slightly differently

- Scale Octave Tuning (1 byte) (RT/NRT)
- Scale Octave Tuning (2 bytes) (RT/NRT)
- Single Note Tuning change (RT)
- Single Note Tuning Change (RT/NRT)

### Portamento Implementation

SpessaSynth attempts to mimick the old SC-55 Portamento behavior.

That is:

- Portamento Time is only 7-bit.
- Portamento Control gets overriden with the last portamento key.
- Portamento Time uses
  the [following table by John Novak](https://github.com/dosbox-staging/dosbox-staging/pull/2705#issue-1827830020) and
  linearly interpolates it.
- Portamento Time depends on the distance of the keys.
  The final calculation is `portamentoSeconds = linearInterpolateTable(portamentoTime) * keyDistance / 30` for now.
  If you know a more accurate algortihm, please let me know!
- Portamento is **experimental.** It can be disabled, and it may not work correctly as I do not own an actual SC-55 to
  test it with.
