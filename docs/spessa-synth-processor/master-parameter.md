# Master Parameter

Master parameters can be used to set parameters that affect the entire synthesizer.

They are described below.


### masterGain
The master gain, from 0 to any number. 1 is 100% volume.

### masterPan
The master pan, from -1 (left) to 1 (right). 0 is center.

### voiceCap
The maximum number of voices that can be played at once.

### interpolationType
The interpolation type used for sample playback.
The interpolation types defined are:
 - 0 - linear interpolation - fast, medium quality
 - 1 - nearest neighbor interpolation - fastest, but lowest quality (it may be desirable in some cases to make the sound "crispier")
 - 2 - hermite interpolation - slow, high quality (default)

### midiSystem
The MIDI system used by the synthesizer for bank selects and system exclusives. (GM, GM2, GS, XG, in lowercase)

### monophonicRetriggerMode
Indicates whether the synthesizer is in monophonic retrigger mode.
This emulates the behavior of Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth,
where a new note will kill the previous one if it is still playing.

### reverbGain
The reverb gain, from 0 to any number. 1 is 100% reverb.

### chorusGain
The chorus gain, from 0 to any number. 1 is 100% chorus.

### blackMIDIMode
Forces note killing instead of releasing. Improves performance in black MIDIs.

### transposition
The global transposition in semitones. It can be decimal to provide microtonal tuning.

### deviceID
Synthesizer's device ID for system exclusive messages. Set to -1 to accept all by default.
