# Writing Wave files

SpessaSynth has a helper function for writing wave files.

## audioToWav

Converts PCM audio data into a fully valid wave file.

```ts
const file = audioToWav(audioData, sampleRate, normalizeAudio = true, metadata = {}, loop = undefined);
```

- `audioData` - an `Array` of `Float32Array`s representing the data. For stereo, pass `[leftData, rightData]`.
- `sampleRate` - `number` the sample rate, in Hertz.
- `normalizeAudio` - optional `boolean` - if true, the gain of the entire song will be adjusted, so the max sample is
  always 32,767 or min is always -32,768 (whichever is greater). Recommended.
- `metadata` - optional `Object` described below. All options are string and are optional:
    - `title` - the song's title
    - `artist` - the song's artist
    - `album` - the song's album
    - `genre` - the song's genre
- `loop` - optional `Object` that will write loop points to the file (using the `cue ` chunk)
    - `start` - start time in seconds
    - `end` - end time in seconds

The metadata uses the `INFO` chunk to write the information. It is encoded with `utf-8`
