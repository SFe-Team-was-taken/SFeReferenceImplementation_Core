### modulators

The zone's generators, an array of [`Modulators`](modulator.md)s.

### fineTuning

Allows setting and getting zone's fine-tuning in cents, taking in both coarse and fine generators.

## methods

### setGenerator

- type - the one of the SF2 generator types, a number. `generatorTypes` enum contains all of them.
- value - the value to set it to, a number. Set to `undefined` to delete the generator (unset).
- validate - optional validation for the limits defined in the SF2 specification. recommended.

### getGenerator

Gets a given generator value.

```ts

- type - the one of the SF2 generator types, a number. `generatorTypes` enum contains all of them.
- notFoundValue - what to return if the generator wasn't found. Any type or undefined.

### copyFrom
