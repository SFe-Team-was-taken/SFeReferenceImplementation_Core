# BasicSample

Represents a single sample, a chunk of audio data.

## EmptySample

A helper constructor for creating samples.

```ts
import { EmptySample } from './basic_sample' 
const sample = new EmptySample();
```

!!! Danger

    Properties and methods not listed here are internal only and should not be used.

## Properties

### name

The sample's name as string.


### sampleRate

The sample rate of the sample, in Hertz.
A number.


### originalKey

The MIDI key number of the recorded pitch for this sample.
A number.

### pitchCorrection

The pitch correction to apply in cents. It can be negative.
A number.

### linkedSample

 The other linked sample of the stereo pair.
`BasicSample` or `undefined` if the sample has no link.

### sampleType

The type of the sample, as defined per SF2 specification:

> The value in sfSampleType is an enumeration with eight defined values: monoSample = 1, rightSample = 2, leftSample = 4,
  linkedSample = 8, RomMonoSample = 32769, RomRightSample = 32770, RomLeftSample = 32772, and
  RomLinkedSample = 32776. It can be seen that this is encoded such that bit 15 of the 16 bit value is set if the sample is in
  ROM, and reset if it is included in the SoundFont compatible bank. The four LS bits of the word are then exclusively set
  indicating mono, left, right, or linked.

!!! Warning

    Do not change this value directly. use `setSampleType`, `setLinkedSample` and `unlinkSample` instead.

### loopStart

The sample's loop start index. In sample data points, relative to the start of the sample.

### loopEnd

The sample's loop end index. In sample data points, relative to the start of the sample.

### linkedTo

Sample's linked instruments (the instruments that use it).
Tote that duplicates are allowed since one instrument can use the same sample multiple times.

An array of `BasicInstrument`s.

### isCompressed

Indicates if the sample is compressed. 
A boolean.

### isLinked

If the sample is linked to another sample. 
A boolean.

## Methods

### setSampleType

Sets the sample type and unlinks if needed.

```ts
sample.setSampleType(type);
```

- type - the type to set it to. `sampleTypes` enum contains all valid types.

### unlinkSample

Unlinks the sample from its stereo link if it has any.

### setLinkedSample

Links a stereo sample.

```ts
sample.setLinkedSample(sample, type);
```
- sample - the BasicSample to link to.
- type - the type to set it to. `sampleTypes` enum contains all valid types.

### getAudioData

Gets the PCM `Float32Array` audio data and stores it internally for reuse. It decodes compressed samples if necessary.

The returned value is a `Float32Array` containing the PCM audio data for the sample.

### resampleData

Resamples the audio data to a given sample rate.

```ts
sample.resampleData(newSampleRate);
```

- newSampleRate - the new sample rate, in Hertz.

### setAudioData

Replaces the audio data *in-place*.

```ts
sample.setAudioData(audioData, sampleRate);
```

 - audioData - the new audio data as Float32Array.
 - sampleRate - the new sample rate, in Hertz.
